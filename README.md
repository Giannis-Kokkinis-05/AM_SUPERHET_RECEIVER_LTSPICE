# AM_SUPERHET_RECEIVER_LTSPICE
Little summer project. Goal is to retract a 4kHz sine wave. Input is different AM stations broadcasting at 20kHz apart. I also run a monte-carlo simulation in order to find out how it responds to tolerance in component values and I uploaded the results. I have not implemented this.
